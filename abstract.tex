Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) commonly share the Last Level Cache (LLC) to improve resource utilization.
Thus, co-running processes compete for cache space which can result in significant and unpredictable performance loss.

Introduce cache partitioning: explicit and implicit

Contribution 1:  the classification scheme

Contribution 2: Using the classification scheme on miss minimizing dynamic cache partitioning techniques to identify overlap.

Contribution 3: A quantitative comparison of 5 high-impact miss minimizing dynamic cache partitioning techniques.
