\section{Introduction}

\magnus{Write introduction}

Meta-analysis is common in other fields (i.e.\ medicine) but uncommon in computer architecture (Notable exceptions: \cite{microlib,comparingPrevalingSimulationTechniques,desmet10}).
For mature research areas, they are necessary for navigating the complex research landscape.

\magnus{Define the cache partitioning problem}

Cache partitioning is a suitable field: A large body of work exists, and the subfield is becoming mature (first work early 2000s).
Each author only compares to one or two other works and methodology differs: Unclear if science is actually progressing.

Any resource management technique (like shared cache partitioning) consists of three components \cite{virtualPrivateMachines}: Policy, feedback mechanism and partitioning mechanism.
We reviewed the literature, classified the previous works along these axes and found significant overlap.

\magnus{Introduce the techniques we chose to compare quantitatively and present a plausible argument for why these were chosen}

Our contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A through literature survey of proposed cache partitioning techniques
	\item Many techniques reuse components from other schemes: Our work is to our knowledge the first work to systematically report these overlaps
	\item A quantitative comparison of selected techniques \magnus{Can we be bolder?}
	\item We aim to provide our implementations to the research community
\end{itemize}

\toni{Add the missing works after Runar has added his stuff}

\textit{We should retrieve the number of citations of each work from Google Scholar.
The older techniques we have implemented are likely cited a lot and then we can argue for why we selected the less cited works.}
